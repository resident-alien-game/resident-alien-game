### Phase 1: Brainstorming and Concepts

<img src="doc/image.png">

We have brainstormed to come up with this game concept of a 3D thrilling game where you play as an alien trying to 
fix your crashed spaceship and escape from the inspired by the TV show <strong> Resident Alien </strong>. The game will be a third-person game with a focus on exploration 
and puzzle-solving. The game will be set in a large open world with a variety of environments, 
including forests, mountains, and deserts. The game will feature a variety of skills that the player can use to 
fight off enemies and solve puzzles. The game will also feature a variety of enemies, including humans, robots, 
and other aliens. The game will have a strong focus on story and character development, with a variety of side quests 
and other activities for the player to engage in. The game will be developed using the Unity game engine and 
will be released on PC and consoles.

We have created a prototype of the game to demonstrate the core gameplay mechanics and features.
- Alien: The player controls an alien character who has crash-landed on Earth and is trying to repair his spaceship and escape.
  1. The <span style="color:red;"> red box </span> represents the alien character in alien form. 
  2. The <span style="color:blue;"> blue box </span> represents the alien character in human form.
- Kid: The kid is represented by the <span style="color:green;"> green box </span>. The kid is a non-playable character who can force the alien to change back to alien form if it's in the human form.
- Civilian: The civilian is represented by the <span style="color:purple;"> purple box </span>. The civilian is a non-playable character who can call the police if it sees the food/drink get stolen. Also, the alien can only change into human form after kill a civlian.
- Food/Drink: The food/drink is represented by the food/drink like items. The alien can steal the food/drink to recover health/energy.
- Police: The police is represented by the <span style="color:yellow;"> yellow box </span>. The police is a non-playable character who will do the following:
  1. If the police sees the alien in alien form, the police will chase and shoot the alien.
  2. If the police sees a dead civilian, it will chase and shoot the alien even if it is in human form.
  3. If the police gets called that food/drink is stolen, it will chase the alien.
- FBI: The FBI is represented by the <span style="color:orange;"> orange box </span>. It will collect the ship piece so that the alien may not be able to rebuild the ship and escape.
- Ship Piece: The ship piece is represented by the <span style="color:grey;"> grey coin </span>. The alien needs to collect at least 5 of the ship pieces to rebuild the ship and escape.
- Houses: The houses are represented by the brick looking open boxes. The alien can enter the houses to steal food/drink or hide from the police.

This is our current and final version of the game:

In this version, we have made the following changes to the game:
- House textures: We have added textures to the houses to make them look more realistic.
- Alien: We have added 2 forms of alien, alien form and human form each has it's own look. The alien can change between the two forms. Also we have added animations to the alien character.
- Kid: We have add the new look of the kid with animations.
- FBI: We have added the FBI character with animations.
- Police: We have added the police character with animations of walking for patrolling, running for chaseing and shooting.
- Civilian: We have added the civilian character with animations of walking.
- Pieces: We have added the more realistic ship pieces with animations of spinning.
- Trees: We have added the trees to the game.
- Skybox: We have added the skybox to the game.
- Sound: We have added the sound effects to the game.
- UI: We have added the health and energy bar to the game instead of the text. We also make the pieces collection more noticeable in the UI.
- Grass: We have added the grass to the game
- Lighting: We have changed lighting to the game to a dark light so it will be a little bit harder to find the pieces. We have also added a new light source, while a UFO flying around the map it will shine a bright light on the ground.
