### Phase 1: Brainstorming and Concepts

<img src="doc/image.png">

We have brainstormed to come up with this game concept of a 3D thrilling game where you play as an alien trying to 
fix your crashed spaceship and escape from the inspired by the TV show <strong> Resident Alien </strong>. The game will be a third-person game with a focus on exploration 
and puzzle-solving. The game will be set in a large open world with a variety of environments, 
including forests, mountains, and deserts. The game will feature a variety of skills that the player can use to 
fight off enemies and solve puzzles. The game will also feature a variety of enemies, including humans, robots, 
and other aliens. The game will have a strong focus on story and character development, with a variety of side quests 
and other activities for the player to engage in. The game will be developed using the Unity game engine and 
will be released on PC and consoles.

We have created a prototype of the game to demonstrate the core gameplay mechanics and features.
